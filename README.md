# 🧩 Problem-Solving Archive

This repository contains my solutions to problems from **LeetCode**, **Codeforces**, and other competitive programming platforms.  
It is organized for **easy navigation, revision**.

<!-- , and interview prep**. -->

### Example:

- `leetcode/easy/arrays/two-sum.cpp`
- `codeforces/1800/a.cpp`
<!-- - `atcoder/abc300/a.cpp`
- `icpc/2024-arabic-north-africa/contest1.cpp` -->

## 🏆 Platforms Covered

- **LeetCode** → By difficulty → topic-based organization
- **Codeforces** → By contest number
<!-- - **AtCoder** → By contest (ABC, ARC, etc.)
- **ICPC** → By year and regional contest -->
